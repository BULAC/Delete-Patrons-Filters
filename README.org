* Delete::Patrons::Filters

add some filters to the Koha delete_patrons.pl script and ship it as
filtered_delete_patrons.pl.

WIP, not working yet, donâ€™t use it in production.

Right now, it only prevents the script from deleting patrons with
something in the borrowernotes field.

* Usage

#+begin_src shell
dzil build
dzil install
#+end_src shell
